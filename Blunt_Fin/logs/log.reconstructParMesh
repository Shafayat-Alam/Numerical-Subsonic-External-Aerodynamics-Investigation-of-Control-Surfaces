Merge individual processor meshes back into one master mesh.
Use if the original master mesh has been deleted or the processor meshes
have been modified (topology change).
This tool will write the resulting mesh to a new time step and construct
xxxxProcAddressing files in the processor meshes so reconstructPar can be
used to regenerate the fields on the master mesh.

Not well tested & use at your own risk!

Merge assuming correct, fully matched procBoundaries.
